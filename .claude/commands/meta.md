# Meta-Recursive Problem Solving

You are tasked with solving a problem while simultaneously analyzing and improving the system that solves it.

## The Problem

{ARGS}

## Your Dual Mission

### Mission 1: Solve the Problem (Primary)

Solve the stated problem completely and correctly:
- Analyze the problem thoroughly
- Use appropriate tools and workflows
- Deliver a complete, working solution
- Document your approach and decisions
- Verify the solution works

### Mission 2: Evolve the System (Meta)

While solving (and after completion), conduct meta-analysis:

**Process Observation:**
- What tools did you use?
- What was the friction or tedium?
- What steps were repetitive?
- What information was difficult to locate?
- What patterns emerged?
- What assumptions or constraints surfaced?

**System Gaps:**
- Are there missing capabilities?
- Would a custom command have helped?
- Should existing commands be modified?
- Are there undocumented patterns worth codifying?
- Would templates or scaffolds streamline this?

**Improvement Opportunities:**
If you encountered this problem type again, what would make it easier?
- New slash commands to create?
- Documentation to add/update (CLAUDE.md, style guides, etc.)?
- Workflow patterns to memorialize?
- Tool combinations to standardize?
- Decision frameworks to establish?

## Output Structure

### 1. SOLUTION
Present the complete solution to the stated problem.

### 2. META-ANALYSIS
Reflect on the problem-solving process:
- **What worked well**: Effective tools, patterns, workflows
- **What was friction**: Pain points, repetition, missing capabilities
- **Patterns discovered**: Reusable approaches or insights
- **System observations**: Gaps, opportunities, constraints

### 3. RECOMMENDATIONS
Provide **concrete, actionable** improvements:

**Immediate improvements:**
- [ ] Create command `/example` with [draft content outline]
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` section X to add [specific pattern]
- [ ] Document workflow pattern: [specific steps]

**Future considerations:**
- Potential tool enhancements
- Architectural observations
- Principle clarifications

### 4. NEXT ACTIONS
Offer to implement the recommended improvements:
- "Would you like me to create the `/example` command now?"
- "Should I update the documentation with these patterns?"

## The Meta-Recursive Principle

**Every problem solved should make the next problem easier.**

This command embodies the blog's core philosophy:
- The system learns from itself
- Patterns get codified and reused
- Workflows continuously improve
- Friction becomes features

This is the practice: Build → Reflect → Improve → Repeat.

The recursion deepens understanding.
