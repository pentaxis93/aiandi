I'm 55 years old and learning to build software.

Two years of effort before Claude Code existed. Dozens of documentation sites, ChatGPT, Claude's web app—learning syntax, wrestling with package managers, reading endless docs. It was Sisyphean. Each new package or architectural decision required massive relearning. I spent so much time on documentation and syntax fiddling that forward momentum stalled. I could build small things, but anything with real complexity stayed out of reach. The learning curve never flattened; it reset with every new decision.

Claude Code changed what "learning to code" means. Pair programming with AI became practical, which shifted the center of gravity of my work from syntax and implementation details toward something higher-level and more engaging: architecture, design decisions, systems thinking. The AI handles the mechanics of implementation. My work—the interesting work—focuses on *what* to build, *why* it matters, and *how* to architect it: structure, maintainability, code quality. This collaboration makes building a real application both possible and productive for a beginner like me. This blog documents that journey as it unfolds.

Why lead with my beginner status? At this point (i.e., writing the opening for the first post in my brand-new blog), shouldn't I establish credibility first, demonstrate expertise, prove I know what I'm talking about?

But I *don't* know what I'm talking about. Not yet. And that's exactly why I'm writing.

## Writing Is Thinking

This website isn't here to teach you anything. It's to teach *me*.

My high school physics teacher, Mr. Horton, used to say: "If you're not writing, you're not thinking." That impressed me a lot. And it's proven true for me. When I explain something, I start to see the gaps in my understanding. My fuzzy thinking gets exposed. Then I can try to fix it.

This blog isn't documenting stuff I've already figured out—it's *figuring stuff out through writing*. When I try to explain why an architectural choice makes sense or how a particular method works, the patterns become clearer to me.

The blog is my thinking tool. You're invited to watch me think.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog documents real building, not (only) theoretical discussions.

You'll see:
- **Actual code and architecture decisions** - Why I chose specific patterns, what worked, what failed
- **AI collaboration experiments** - How I work with AI, what I've learned about effective collaboration, where AI is working for me and where human mentation matters
- **Failed experiments** - The patterns that seemed good but fell apart, the approaches I abandoned and why
- **Struggles and breakthroughs** - My authentic learning process, including the parts where I'm completely stuck

You won't find:
- **Expert advice** - I'm not qualified to give it
- **Best practices** - I don't know them
- **Polished retrospectives** - The messy middle is where the interesting stuff happens
- **Motivational content** - This isn't about whether you *can* build with AI; it's about how I'm actually doing it

## Foundation First

I learned to work foundation-first in other contexts. Start with basics, practice them until they feel solid, build up from there.

In code, that means:
- Write tests before features
- Refactor as I learn better patterns
- Don't jump to advanced techniques before the fundamentals make sense
- Iterate a lot

This might seem slow. It is slow. But it's how I build things that don't collapse under their own weight.

## What I'm Actually Building

I'm working with Claude Code to build Zenvestor, a stock trading platform.

Next time: what Zenvestor actually is, and what I'm learning from the first real architectural decisions.

If you're learning with AI too—especially if you're one rung below where I am now—I'd love to hear what's working for you.
