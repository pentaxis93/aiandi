title = "Why I'm Writing This: Building Real Software with AI"
+++

I'm 55 years old, and I'm learning to build software.

Not learning to code, exactly. The AI does most of the actual coding. I'm learning to *architect*, to make design decisions, to think in systems and patterns. I'm building a real application—a stock trading platform called Zenvestor—through collaboration with Claude, using Flutter and Dart. And I'm writing about it here, in public, as I figure it out.

This might seem like an odd confession to lead with. Why tell you I'm a beginner? Shouldn't I establish credibility first, demonstrate expertise, prove I know what I'm talking about?

But here's the thing: I *don't* know what I'm talking about. Not yet. And that's exactly why I'm writing.

## Writing Clarifies Thinking

The primary reason for this blog isn't to teach you anything. It's to teach *me*.

I've learned over five decades that writing is how I think. When I try to explain something clearly—to articulate why I made a particular choice, how a system works, what problem I'm actually solving—I discover what I don't understand. The gaps show up. The fuzzy thinking gets exposed. And then I can fix it.

So when I write about Zenvestor's architecture, I'm not documenting decisions I've already figured out. I'm *figuring them out through the act of writing*. When I explain why I chose clean architecture or test-driven development, I'm clarifying for myself what these patterns actually mean and how they apply to my specific context.

The blog is my thinking tool. You're invited to watch me think.

## The One Rung Below Principle

There's a teaching in some Buddhist traditions: we help those who are one rung below us on the ladder.

I can't help experienced developers who've been building production systems for twenty years. I don't have that wisdom yet. But I *can* help someone who's where I was six months ago—wanting to build with AI, uncertain where to start, overwhelmed by architectural decisions, wondering if it's even possible to create something real.

If you're a beginner trying to build with AI, or thinking about starting, or experimenting with different approaches—I'm one rung above you. Maybe two. I've made mistakes you haven't made yet. I've discovered patterns that work and patterns that fail spectacularly. I can show you what I've learned, even while I'm still learning.

That's the audience I'm writing for: fellow beginners who could benefit from seeing someone slightly ahead fumbling through the same challenges.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog documents real building, not theoretical discussions.

You'll see:
- **Actual code and architecture decisions** - Why I chose specific patterns, what worked, what failed
- **AI collaboration experiments** - How I work with Claude, what I've learned about effective collaboration, where AI excels and where human judgment matters
- **Complete projects, not just demos** - I've already shipped a self-hosted Ghost blog (my first complete project with AI). Zenvestor is the next.
- **Failed experiments** - The patterns that seemed good but fell apart, the approaches I abandoned and why
- **Real struggles and breakthroughs** - Authentic learning process, including the parts where I'm completely stuck

You won't find:
- **Expert advice** - I'm not qualified to give it
- **Best practices lectures** - I'm still discovering what works
- **Polished retrospectives** - The messy middle is where the interesting stuff happens
- **Motivational content** - This isn't about whether you *can* build with AI. It's about how I'm actually doing it.

## The Foundation-First Philosophy

One thing I bring from decades of other work: a foundation-first approach to everything.

Whether it's meditation practice, understanding complex systems, or building software—I've learned to start with fundamentals. Build the base solid. Let complexity emerge naturally from simple principles well understood.

You'll see this throughout the blog. I don't jump to advanced patterns before understanding basics. I don't add features before the architecture is sound. I don't write production code without tests.

This might seem slow. It is slow. But it's how I build things that don't collapse under their own weight.

## About Those Deeper Connections

Sometimes—not always, but sometimes—I'll notice connections between code and consciousness. Between architectural patterns and ways of thinking. Between technical problems and questions that philosophers have pondered for centuries.

When that happens, I'll mention it. Lightly. Not as spiritual teaching, but as observation. The code will always be real and practical. The connections will be there for those interested. Others can focus purely on the technical content—it stands on its own.

Think of it as breadcrumbs for those who want to follow them, and perfectly good signposts for those who don't.

## What I'm Actually Building

Zenvestor is a stock trading platform for disciplined, systematic traders. It's solving real problems I have: automating complex multi-stage trades, removing emotional decision-making, tracking everything with integrated journaling, transforming a 2-hour daily workflow into 15 minutes.

But it's also my learning vehicle. Complex enough to require real architecture. Simple enough for a beginner to understand. Practical enough that I'll actually use it.

I'll write more about Zenvestor itself in the next article. For now, just know: it's real, I'm building it, and you'll see the whole messy process.

## What I'm Asking From You

Try things. Seriously. Don't just read about patterns—implement them. Don't just understand concepts—build something with them. 

If something I write about seems useful, experiment with it in your own projects. If something seems wrong, try it anyway and discover *why* it's wrong for your context. The learning is in the doing, not the reading.

And if you discover things I should know, if you spot places where I'm heading down a wrong path, if you see connections I'm missing—tell me. I'm learning here. Your insights help.

## The Promise

I promise you:
- **Authenticity** - I won't pretend to know more than I do
- **Real work** - Everything documented is actually built and tested
- **Technical accuracy** - Code will be correct and runnable
- **Appropriate vulnerability** - Honest about struggles without oversharing
- **Useful content** - Patterns that actually help others build things

I won't promise expertise I don't have. I won't claim this is the "right" way. I'm documenting *one* beginner's journey, learning to build real software with AI collaboration, foundation-first, test-driven, architecturally sound.

If you're on a similar journey, welcome. Let's learn together.
