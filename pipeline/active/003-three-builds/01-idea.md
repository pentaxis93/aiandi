# Building the Same Project Three Times (and Why That Wasn't Failure)

## One-Sentence Teaching

Learning through iteration—rebuilding the same project in different frameworks—teaches what each tool is actually good at, not what the marketing says.

## Why It Matters

Most beginners feel shame when they restart projects. They see each rebuild as evidence of failure or indecision, not recognizing that this is how experienced developers actually learn to evaluate tools.

## The Story

Building the same gallery project multiple times:
- First attempt: Next.js
- Second attempt: React
- Third attempt: RedwoodJS
- Fourth attempt: Svelte
- Final decision: Flutter/Dart

Each iteration revealed what the framework was truly good at versus what the marketing promised.

## What You Learned

- How to evaluate tools through use, not hype
- What each framework excelled at (and where it fell short)
- Why Flutter/Dart ultimately won for this particular use case
- That "wasted work" is actually the tuition for real learning
- How to recognize when framework marketing diverges from reality

## Story Type

**Evolution** - "X changed from A to B"

The arc: Starting naive → Pressure from reality → Multiple transitions → New understanding → Reflection on the journey

## Target Audience

Self-taught developers who:
- Feel guilty about abandoned projects
- Struggle with "analysis paralysis" in framework selection
- Don't trust their ability to evaluate tools
- Think reading docs should be enough (without hands-on experience)

## Core Message

The "wasted work" phase isn't failure—it's how you develop taste. Every abandoned rebuild taught you something the documentation never could. This is normal. This is the path.
