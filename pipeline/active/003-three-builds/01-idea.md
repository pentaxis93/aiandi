# Discovering the Real Problem

*Working title - may evolve*

## One-Sentence Teaching

Discovering the real problem is 80% of problem-solving - and iteration is how you discover it.

## Why It Matters

Developers often see framework changes or project rebuilds as indecision or wasted work. But iteration isn't starting over - it's problem discovery. Each rebuild reveals what you're actually trying to solve.

## The Story

5th Ave. Gallery - a domain bought from E.J. Gold (his former art site) - rebuilt across multiple frameworks:
- Next.js (loved it, but web-only)
- RedwoodJS (brief - but testing opened eyes to quality)
- Svelte (simpler state, but still web-only)
- Flutter/Dart (solved the real problem: mobile+web)

The framework journey wasn't about finding the "best" framework. It was about discovering the real problem: multi-platform development with maintainable architecture.

## What You Learned

- Iteration is methodology, not failure (McKinsey training: complete story at each checkpoint, then iterate)
- Framework changes revealed the actual requirement (mobile+web, not just web)
- Maintainability matters: build so the maintenance burden doesn't scale with complexity
- Each iteration was a complete attempt, not partial work abandoned

## Story Type

**Evolution** - "X changed from A to B"

The arc: Professional iteration practice → Applied to framework selection → Discovered the real problem → Built for sustainability

## Target Audience

Developers who:
- Feel their project restarts indicate failure
- Are evaluating frameworks without knowing what problem they're solving
- Want to build something maintainable long-term
- Could benefit from seeing iteration as professional practice, not indecision

## Core Message

The frameworks weren't the point. Discovering that you needed mobile+web was the point. Discovering that maintainability mattered was the point. Iteration is how you get there.

## Context

- 5th Ave. Gallery: domain from E.J. Gold, intended as online ashram, still becoming what it wants to be
- McKinsey background: trained in iteration as the path from good to great
- Maintainability lesson: learned from years of projects that fell apart

## Threads to Weave

1. **Iteration as methodology** - not starting over, complete stories each time
2. **Problem discovery** - 80% of solving is finding the real problem
3. **Sustainable building** - maintenance burden that doesn't scale with complexity
