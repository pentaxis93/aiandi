# Synthesis Prep: Discovering the Real Problem

**Slug:** three-builds  
**Stage:** SYNTHESIS-PREP  
**One-sentence teaching:** Discovering the real problem is 80% of problem-solving - and iteration is how you discover it.

---

## Section 1: The Domain with History

**What this section does:** Grounds the story in a specific, unexpected starting point - not "I was learning frameworks" but "I bought an artist's domain and tried to make an ashram."

**How it should feel:** Concrete, slightly whimsical, establishes that the journey had texture from the start. Not apologetic - just factual about unconventional beginnings.

**Key material:**
- 5th Ave. Gallery: domain purchased from E.J. Gold
- E.J. Gold: artist, the site was about his gallery work
- Original intention: online ashram (not a gallery)
- "No matter what I put up there, it becomes a gallery of projects"
- Still becoming what it wants to be - tribute not yet found

**Narrative intent:** Establish that this isn't a clean "beginner learns frameworks" story. There's history, intention, unfinished threads. The domain itself embodies iteration - it keeps becoming something new.

**Voice opportunity:** The "gallery of projects" reframe - taking what could be awkward (mismatched name) and making it true in a different way.

**Evidence:** Walk transcript lines 89-93, 111

**Heading for draft:** *(none - first section, article title serves)*

## Section 2: The McKinsey Frame

**What this section does:** Reframes the entire story before the reader can impose the "shame about abandoned projects" narrative. Iteration isn't failure - it's trained methodology.

**How it should feel:** Confident, matter-of-fact. Not defensive. This is just how good work happens.

**Key material:**
- "Iterating is not starting over, that's the way McKinsey works"
- Three-month projects: three checkpoints, complete story each time
- "You come in and you have a complete story. Some research won't be done, some analysis will be planned, but the story itself is still complete"
- "From good to great results"
- "Discovering the real problem is 80% of problem-solving" (the spine)

**Narrative intent:** Give the reader a lens before they need it. When framework changes come, they'll see methodology, not indecision.

**Voice opportunity:** Teaching through specific example (the three-checkpoint structure) rather than abstract principle. The McKinsey framing earns authority without claiming expertise.

**Evidence:** Walk transcript lines 105, 109; user conversation ("80% of problem-solving")

**Heading for draft:** ## Complete Stories at Every Checkpoint

## Section 3: The Framework Journey (Compressed)

**What this section does:** Moves through the frameworks quickly - this isn't a framework comparison article. Each framework teaches one thing, reveals one gap.

**How it should feel:** Efficient, not exhaustive. The point isn't the frameworks - it's what iteration revealed.

**Key material:**
- Next.js: loved it, would have stayed. But web-only. "What makes Next.js so complex is that it's dealing with the complexity of modern web apps."
- RedwoodJS: brief, but "the testing, the automatic unit testing... opened my eyes to a new way to see quality"
- Svelte: simpler state management, but "doesn't answer the fundamental question"
- The fundamental question emerging: mobile+web, not just web

**Narrative intent:** Show iteration in action without dwelling. Each pass is complete, each reveals something, the real problem comes into focus.

**Voice opportunity:** Not reviewing frameworks - just noting what each one illuminated. The RedwoodJS detail (3 days, but the testing insight stuck) shows how short iterations still teach.

**Evidence:** Walk transcript lines 95-99, 100-101, 107; Research doc (GitHub dates confirm RedwoodJS was 3 days)

**Heading for draft:** ## What Each Framework Revealed

## Section 4: The Real Problem Emerges

**What this section does:** The pivot. The question wasn't "which JavaScript framework" - it was "how do I build for mobile and web at the same time?"

**How it should feel:** Clarity arriving. Not dramatic revelation - more like fog lifting.

**Key material:**
- "I realized I probably shouldn't be building just web apps. I should be building apps that at least work on phones as well as web."
- Flutter/Dart as the answer to the actual question
- "A beautifully engineered spaceship"
- The problem discovery itself is the value - 80% of solving

**Narrative intent:** This is the teaching made concrete. The framework journey wasn't about frameworks. It was about discovering mobile+web was the real requirement.

**Voice opportunity:** "Beautifully engineered spaceship" - let genuine appreciation show. Not selling Flutter, just noting what fit.

**Evidence:** Walk transcript lines 97-99

**Heading for draft:** ## The Question Behind the Question

## Section 5: The Deeper Layer - Building to Last

**What this section does:** Goes beneath the framework story to the sustainability story. Why maintainability matters. What happens when projects can't survive your absence.

**How it should feel:** Earned gravity. Not tragic - forward-looking. "Positive lesson learned" framing per author request.

**Key material:**
- "I really want to build something where the maintenance burden won't necessarily scale with complexity"
- "Continue to iterate on and refine for years to come and always be able to maintain it"
- Projects that fell apart when energy dropped (acknowledge without dwelling)
- AI coding amplifies this: "The AI can just write so much code so the trick is to get it to generate that code in a way that is maintainable"
- Testing insight from RedwoodJS connects here - quality as sustainability

**Narrative intent:** The framework journey was also a maintainability journey. Each iteration wasn't just finding the right tool - it was learning what "lasting" requires.

**Voice opportunity:** The AI-amplification point is fresh and specific. Most "maintainability" writing is abstract - this grounds it in the actual challenge of AI-generated code volume.

**Evidence:** Walk transcript lines 101-103

## Section 6: For the Developer with Abandoned Projects

**What this section does:** Turns outward. Speaks to readers who might be where the author was - but without the McKinsey frame, feeling shame instead of methodology.

**How it should feel:** Generous but not preachy. Offering a reframe, not a lecture.

**Key material:**
- "It's probably better to finish stuff rather than abandon it even if you finish it in a very preliminary form"
- "But I understand when the excitement of the new next thing is so great..."
- AI agents changed this: "much easier to wrap stuff up little projects... MVP finished product instead of abandonware"
- The reframe: iteration isn't starting over, it's problem discovery

**Narrative intent:** Give readers permission to see their "failures" differently. Provide the practical note about AI helping with finishing.

**Voice opportunity:** The "excitement of the new next thing" acknowledges the pull without judgment. Meets the reader where they are.

**Evidence:** Walk transcript lines 115

## Closing Movement

**What this section does:** Lands the teaching. Returns to 5th Ave. Gallery - still becoming, still iterating, and that's fine.

**How it should feel:** Open-ended but complete. Not triumphant resolution - ongoing practice.

**Key material:**
- 5th Ave. Gallery still work in progress
- "A gallery of projects" - the name keeps being true
- Discovering the real problem is 80% of problem-solving
- Iteration continues

**Narrative intent:** Close the frame opened in section 1. The domain that keeps becoming something new mirrors the teaching - iteration never really ends.

**Voice opportunity:** Light touch. Don't over-conclude. The teaching has been demonstrated; trust the reader.

**Evidence:** Walk transcript line 93

## Quality Gate Checklist

Before handing to the-art:

- [x] NO bullet-point structure (each section has thematic guidance)
- [x] Each section has thematic guidance
- [x] Evidence is library (not template to expand)
- [x] Tone/feel specified for each section
- [x] Narrative intent clear
- [x] Voice opportunities identified

**Gate question:** Could the-art synthesize this into unified teaching?

**Assessment:** Yes. The spine is clear (iteration → problem discovery → building to last), the material is organized by purpose not sequence, and the voice opportunities are marked.

*Sol prepared. Ready for synthesis.*
