# Discovering the Real Problem

I bought a domain from an artist named E.J. Gold. It was called 5th Ave. Gallery, and it had been his site for years, showcasing his work with art and galleries. I had plans for it. An online ashram, maybe. A place for experiments. The name didn't quite fit what I wanted to build, but I figured that was fine. No matter what I put up there, it becomes a gallery of projects.

That turned out to be truer than I expected.

## Complete Stories at Every Checkpoint

At McKinsey, we learned that discovering the real problem is 80% of problem-solving. The other thing we learned was iteration. On a three-month engagement, you'd have three major checkpoints, roughly monthly. And at each checkpoint, you'd present a complete story.

Not a third of the story. A complete story.

Some of the research wouldn't be done yet. Some analysis would still be planned. But the story itself was whole. Then you'd iterate the whole thing. And iterate again. Each pass was complete. Each pass revealed something the previous one couldn't.

I never had a problem with so-called starting over. That's not what iteration is. Iteration is how you get from good to great results.

## What Each Framework Revealed

The first serious build of 5th Ave. Gallery was in Next.js. I loved it. I was getting to appreciate the beauty of TypeScript, even with JavaScript's messy evolutionary legacy underneath. I would have stayed with Next.js.

But I started noticing the complexity. The caching. The layers of abstraction dealing with problems I didn't fully understand yet. CS50 hadn't covered web development, and Next.js was throwing me into the deep end of modern web app architecture. Eventually I realized: the complexity wasn't the framework's fault. Next.js is complex because modern web apps are complex.

And that's when the real question started forming.

Somewhere in there I tried RedwoodJS. Three days, maybe. But in those three days, one thing stuck: the automatic unit testing. That opened my eyes to a different way of seeing quality. The framework didn't last, but that insight did.

Svelte came next. I'd read it had simpler state management than React, and that was true. But simpler state management wasn't the problem I needed to solve.

## The Question Behind the Question

The question I'd been trying to answer wasn't "which JavaScript framework should I use?"

It was: how do I build something that works on phones and web at the same time?

Once I saw that, the framework hopping made sense. Next.js, RedwoodJS, Svelte: all web-first. They weren't failing me. They were answering a different question than the one I actually had.

Flutter and Dart answered the right question. Multi-platform from the start. And Dart itself feels like a beautifully engineered spaceship to me. Clean. Intentional. None of the archaeological layers of JavaScript's evolution.

The frameworks weren't the point. Discovering mobile+web was the point. Each iteration was a complete attempt at solving what I thought was the problem, and each one revealed that the problem was something else.

## Maintenance Burden

There's another thread underneath all of this.

Over the years, I've started many projects. When I had energy, I'd build. Websites. Businesses, even. But when my energy dropped, I'd lose the day-to-day involvement. I'd forget how things worked. Projects would fall apart and become unmaintainable.

So now I really want to build something where the maintenance burden doesn't scale with complexity. Something I can iterate on and refine for years and still be able to maintain.

This matters even more with AI coding. The AI can generate so much code, so fast. The trick is getting it to generate code that stays maintainable, where the burden doesn't grow exponentially with the codebase.

The testing insight from RedwoodJS connects here. Quality isn't just about working code. It's about code that can survive your absence.

## Three Abandoned Projects

If you're a developer with three abandoned projects, I get it.

It's probably better to finish things, even in preliminary form. But I understand when the excitement of the next thing is so strong you can't bear to spend energy on the old thing.

Here's what's changed for me: with AI agents, it's much easier to wrap up small projects properly. A README. A license. Package it nicely. Things that used to feel like too much friction now take moments. More MVP finished products, less abandonware.

But more than that: those abandoned projects might not be failures. They might be iterations. Each one a complete attempt, each one revealing what the real problem actually is.

Discovering the real problem is 80% of problem-solving.

## Still Becoming

5th Ave. Gallery is still a work in progress. I'd like the site to pay homage to E.J. Gold somehow, but I haven't found the way that feels authentic yet. Meanwhile, it keeps becoming something new.

A gallery of projects. The name keeps being true in ways I didn't plan.

That's iteration. You come in with a complete story, and the story shows you what it actually wants to be. Then you iterate again.
