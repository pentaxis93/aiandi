# Walking Guide: Building the Same Project Three Times

**Story type:** Evolution  
**Arc:** Origin State → Pressure → Transition → New State → Reflection  
**Duration:** 30-40 minutes  
**Recording:** Voice memo on phone

## Before You Walk

**Context refresh:**
- Three gallery repos: 5th-avegallery-svelte → -OLD → final (Jul 2023 - Oct 2024)
- Framework journey: Next.js → React → RedwoodJS → Svelte → Flutter/Dart
- Age 54-55 during this journey, post-CS50, post-recovery
- Now: Zenvestor in Dart/Flutter (159k LOC)

**What we're extracting:**
- What each framework taught you (that docs couldn't)
- How you knew when to rebuild
- The emotional journey from shame to understanding
- What beginners need to hear

**Recording stance:**
- Speak naturally, like telling a friend
- Don't worry about structure - we'll extract that later
- If a question doesn't land, skip it
- Follow your energy - if something wants more exploration, go there

## Quarter 1: Origin State
*The gallery project begins. What were you building and why?*

### The Beginning

**Tell me about the gallery project when you first started it.**
- What was it supposed to do?
- Why a gallery? What made that interesting?
- What were you trying to learn?

**What framework did you start with?**
- Why that one? What drew you to it?
- What did you expect it would be like?
- What were you excited about?

**What was your mental state as a developer at that point?**
- How long after CS50 was this?
- What did you believe about how to choose frameworks?
- What did you think "experienced developers" did?

---

## Quarter 2: Pressure & First Transitions
*Something starts not working. The rebuilding begins.*

### When It Started to Break

**What made you rebuild the first time?**
- Was there a specific moment or gradual dissatisfaction?
- What wasn't working the way you expected?
- What was the framework doing that felt wrong?

**How did you feel about starting over?**
- Did it feel like failure?
- Did you tell yourself any story about why you were rebuilding?
- What did you fear people would think?

### The Framework Discoveries

**Next.js - what did you learn?**
- What was the promise vs. the reality?
- What specific problem made you move on?
- What did using it reveal that reading docs didn't?

**React - what changed?**
- Why try React after Next.js?
- What was different about working in it?
- What did it teach you about component thinking?

**RedwoodJS - the short experiment**
- What was the appeal? (only 3 days of commits)
- What made you realize it wasn't the answer?
- How did you know so quickly?

**Svelte - what clicked?**
- Three gallery repos in Svelte era - what kept you there?
- What felt different from React?
- What finally made you move on from Svelte too?

## Quarter 3: Transition Completion & New State
*The pattern reveals itself. Flutter/Dart wins.*

### The Turning Point

**When did you realize the rebuilding wasn't waste?**
- Was there a specific moment of insight?
- What shifted in how you saw the process?
- What pattern were you starting to notice?

**How did Flutter/Dart enter the picture?**
- What made you try it after all the JS frameworks?
- What was different about the Dart decision?
- When did you know this one would stick?

### What Each Framework Taught

**Looking at the whole journey - what did each framework reveal?**
- What was each one actually good at?
- What did the marketing obscure?
- What couldn't you have learned without building in it?

**The gallery project itself - how did it change?**
- Was it the same feature set each time?
- Did your understanding of the problem evolve?
- What got simpler? What got more complex?

## Quarter 4: Reflection & Teaching
*What this means for others on the same path.*

### The Deeper Learning

**What did building the same project three times teach you?**
- About frameworks?
- About yourself as a developer?
- About how to evaluate tools?

**How do you evaluate frameworks now?**
- What do you look for that you didn't see before?
- What red flags have you learned to spot?
- What questions do you ask that you didn't at the start?

### For the Beginner Who Feels Shame

**What do you want to say to the developer who has three abandoned projects?**
- What do they need to hear?
- What are they misunderstanding about the process?
- What's the difference between this and analysis paralysis?

**When is rebuilding valuable vs. procrastination?**
- How can you tell the difference?
- What are the signs you're actually learning?
- When should you stick it out vs. start fresh?

### The Age Factor

**Did being 54-55 during this journey affect how you experienced it?**
- Did you have more or less patience than you would have at 25?
- What did decades of other experience bring to this?
- What's different about learning to code later in life?

### The Buddhist Thread

**Any connection to impermanence practice?**
- "All phenomena is illusion" - did that help with letting go?
- Was there a spiritual dimension to rebuilding?
- How does the dharma show up in code?

## Closing Questions

**What haven't I asked that matters?**

**If you could go back and tell yourself something at the start of this journey, what would it be?**

**What's the one thing you want readers to understand about "wasted work"?**

## After the Walk

Save the recording. Don't transcribe immediately - let it rest.

When you're ready to process:
1. Transcribe the recording (voice-to-text or manual)
2. Extract key insights and quotes
3. Map to outline structure
4. Identify the emotional arc that actually emerged

The walk reveals what matters. The transcript captures it. The outline organizes it.

*Walk at your own pace. Let the movement surface what words alone can't reach.*
